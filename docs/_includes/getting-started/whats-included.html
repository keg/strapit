    <h1 id="whats-included" class="page-header">What's included</h1>
    <p class="lead">Strapit is downloadable in two forms, within which you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common resources and providing both compiled and minified variations.</p>
    <div class="callout danger">
      <h4>jQuery required</h4>
      <p>Please note that <strong>all JavaScript plugins require <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a></strong> to be included, as shown in the <a href="#template">starter template</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="whats-included-precompiled">Precompiled Strapit</h3>
    <p>Once downloaded, unzip the compressed folder to see the structure of (the compiled) Strapit. You'll see something like this:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
strapit/
├── css/
│   ├── strapit.css
│   ├── strapit.min.css
├── js/
│   ├── strapit.js
│   └── strapit.min.js
└── fonts/
│   ├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot
│   ├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg
│   ├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf
│   └── glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff
└── img/
    ├── webicons/
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>This is the most basic form of Strapit: compiled files for quick drop-in usage in nearly any web project. We provide compiled CSS and JS, as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS. Fonts from Glyphicons are included and images from Fairfield Creative's FC Webicons.</p>

    <h3 id="whats-included-source">Strapit source code</h3>
        <p>The Strapit source code download includes the precompiled CSS, JavaScript, font and image assets, along with source Less, JavaScript, and documentation. More specifically, it includes the following and more:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
strapit/
├── less/
├── js/
├── fonts/
├── dist/
│   ├── css/
│   ├── js/
│   └── fonts/
│   └── img/
│   └──── webicons/
└── docs/
    └── examples/
{% endhighlight %}
        <p>The <code>less/</code>, <code>js/</code>, and <code>fonts/</code>, and <code>img/</code> are the source code for our CSS, JS, icon fonts and social web icons (respectively). The <code>dist/</code> folder includes everything listed in the precompiled download section above. The <code>docs/</code> folder includes the source code for our documentation, and <code>examples/</code> of Strapit usage. Beyond that, any other included file provides support for packages, license information, and development.</p>

    <h2 id="whats-included-less">Less source code structure</h2>
    <p class="lead">If you download the source code, you'll need to know something about the structure of the Less files within.</p>
    <p>Unzip the compressed folder of the source code and look within the folder named <code>less</code> to see Strapit's pre-complied structure.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
less/
├── custom/
│   ├── *.less
├── framework/
│   ├── *.less
├── prop/
│   ├── application.js
│   └── variables.js
└── vendor/
│   ├── glyphicons.less
│   └── webicons.less
|
└── style.less
{% endhighlight %}
    <p>The <code>custom</code> folder contains all custom style files built exclusively for DFM.</p>
    <p>The <code>framework</code> folder contains all the base style files including the CSS reset, grid, typography and UI objects that come from Bootstrap and Foundation.</p>
    <p>The <code>prop</code> folder contains two files <code>application.less</code> and <code>variables.less</code>. This folder is where the custom files for your site should go. It also includes the variables file that will determine the color palette, spacing and typography choices for your site.</p>
     <p>The <code>application.less</code> file serves as a complier for the custom Less files you create &emdash; similar to the <code>style.less</code> file contained in the root folder. When you open <code>style.less</code>, you will notice that <code>application.less</code> is one of the lasts file within the complication chain. <code>style.less</code> is also where you can comment out the styles you may not need from the master framework files.</p>
     <p>Finally, the <code>vendor</code> folder should contain any third-party plugin style files you want to add into your project. As an example, the <code>glyphicons.less</code> and <code>webicons.less</code> files are contained here.</p>

    <h3 id="whats-included-less-compilation">Less compilation</h3>
    <p class="lead">If you download the original files, you need to compile Strapit's Less files into usable CSS. To do that, you will need a complier. Here are some options:</p>
      <h3>Third party compliers</h3>
      <p>Compliers run alongside your browser and recompile your Less files per save. For Mac users, <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a> or <a href="http://livereload.com/">LiveReload</a> are good options. If you have a Windows machine, <a href="http://wearekiss.com/simpless">SimpLess</a> is an option (it's also available for Mac users) and so is <a href="http://winless.org/">WinLess</a>.</p>
      <h3>Command-line compliers</h3>
      <p>If you are comfortable with the command-line, then some options for you are <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/lesswatcher">Less Watcher</a> (requires npm), <a href="https://github.com/mynyml/watchr">Watchr</a> (requires Ruby Gems), or <a href="http://lesscss.org/#usage/">you can do it by hand</a> (scroll down to Server-side usage).</p>
      <h3>Client-side usage</h3>
      <p>We do not recommend this for many, many reasons, but it's an option. <a href="http://lesscss.org/#usage">Read the documentation</a> on how to do it this way.</p>
