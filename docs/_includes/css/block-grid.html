    <p class="lead">Block grids give you a way to evenly split contents of a list within the grid. If you wanted to create a row of 5 images or paragraphs that need to stay evenly spaced no matter the screen size, the block grid is for you.</h4>

        <h3>Building With Predefined HTML Classes</h3>
        <p>Block grids are made from a <code>ul.sm-block-grid-#</code> or <code>ul.lg-block-grid-#</code>. These are ideal for blocked-in content generated by an application, as they do not require rows or even numbers of elements to display correctly.</p>
        <p>These have a bit of flexibility since you have access to two separate grids between our built-in 768px breakpoint. If you use the <code>sm-block-grid</code> only, the grid will keep its spacing and configuration no matter the screen size. If you use <code>lg-block-grid</code> only, the list items will stack on top of each other for small devices. If you use both of those classes combined, you can control the configuration and layout separately for each breakpoint.</p>

        <h3>Clearing Block Grid Rows</h3>
        <p>We have this built into the CSS, but you'll need to add a bit of code if you want your block grid to change layout between breakpoints. If you don't use this, it will inherit whatever you put in the smallest media query. This code looks for the <code>n+1</code> of the grid so that it clears properly. That code looks like this:</p>
{% highlight html %}
.your-small-class-name > li { clear: none !important; }
{% endhighlight %}
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using the same class across breakpoints, your mixin should override this and you won't need it. If you want to control the layout using different classes, use the above snippet.</p>
